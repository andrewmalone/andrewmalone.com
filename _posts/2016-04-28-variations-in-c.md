  file: Tenor - Variations in C
---
This is a 3 part pattern in C major.

The first section is one of the earliest patterns I can remember coming up with on the ukulele - it is a simple C to F, but with a modified voicing for the F chord.

The other two sections continue to evolve over time - every few months they change slightly, or sometimes I swap one out for a different pattern.
