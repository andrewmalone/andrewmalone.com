This is a pattern I came up with a few weeks ago that I can't seem to get out of my head. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it exactly, but I wanted to get it recorded anyway.

I recorded the ukulele into [JamUp][jamup] on the iPhone using an [Apogee Jam][jam] audio interface. Then I added the simple bass line using [GarageBand][garageband].
