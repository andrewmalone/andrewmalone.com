Earlier this week I was playing with GarageBand on the Mac. I love the drummer tracks, and I've been experimenting with different ways to tweak them for interesting results. This idea started with the drummer track and the bass line, and then everything evolved from there.

All sounds and mixing were done inside GarageBand.
