I recently bought [DrumPerfect][drumperfect] for the iPad, and was trying it out this morning. I came up with this loop:

{% include audio.html audio=page.audio1 %}

DrumPerfect has some excellent realistic drum samples and a really interesting probability feature to create human sounding loops. 

Once I had that loop, I decided to try adding some effects to it, so I loaded it up in [Sequential][sequential] and ended up with this:

{% include audio.html audio=page.audio2 %}
