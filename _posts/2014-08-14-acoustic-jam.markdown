I took the morning off from work today since both kids are in summer camp, which means I was able to spend several hours making some music. This is what I ended up with:

As usual, this was all done on the iPad, mostly in [Cubasis]. Here's a breakdown of what's going on:

* I started with two ukulele tracks. One acoustic using [JamUp], which has some very nice acoustic modeling amps. The more electric track was recorded through [ToneStack], a new amp simulator app which is also pretty amazing (and probably worth it's own post).
* The bass part was also recorded through [JamUp]. With more time I'd probably redo this - it ended up being a little bit too "clicky".
* Piano is [iGrand Piano][iGrand] (I never use anything else).
* After I had most of the instruments done, I decided it needed some drums, so I created a part in [DM1], which is nice because it has the ability to sequence patterns together instead of just making one loop.
* Mixing was all done in [Cubasis], then some final tweaking in [Final Touch].
