This uses the same beat as the [last one]({% post_url 2017-02-25-uke-breakbeat-36 %}), I wanted to try switching the bass line and seeing how that would change the feel and direction. Ultimately, I think this one was not as successful - though the combination of fingerpicking and synth bass is interesting.
