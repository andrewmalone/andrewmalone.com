One of the things I've been doing to work on drum programming is studying drum excersise books. The main beat here is one from [Advanced Funk Studies](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Funk-Studies-Creative-Patterns/dp/0825825539/) which I programmed into the [Patterning] app.

On top of that, there's a basic repeating rhythm part on the ukulele and a bass line.
