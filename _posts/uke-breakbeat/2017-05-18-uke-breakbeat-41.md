This might be the first time I've played a proper piano part in this series. This time I started on the piano to create the chord progression and then added the uke second. I'm really happy with how this came out - there's something about it that perfectly captures the kind of music I'm trying to create. 

The beat is actually two beats layered on top of each other. There's a half time, very basic beat:
{% include audio.html audio=page.beat1 %}
{% include img src="ubb41_1.jpg" alt="KORG Gadget screenshot for beat 1" %}
On top of that, there's a double time more interesting beat:
{% include audio.html audio=page.beat2 %}
{% include img src="ubb41_2.jpg" alt="KORG Gadget screenshot for beat 2" %}

Made with:

* [KORG Gadget]
* [ToneStack]
* [iGrandPiano]
* [Cubasis]
* {% include gear/baritone %}
