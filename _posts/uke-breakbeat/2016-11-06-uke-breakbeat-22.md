Another one using a different app for the beat, this time it's [Sector], which is a probability based loop slicer. I used a beat from the [very first post]({% post_url uke-breakbeat/2016-07-17-uke-breakbeat-1 %}) in this series:

{% include audio.html audio=page.bb1 %}

In [Sector], I slightly sped up and rearranged the beat:

{% include audio.html audio=page.sector %}

Made with:

* [KORG Gadget]
* [Sector]
* [ToneStack]
* [AUM]
* {% include gear/tenor %}
