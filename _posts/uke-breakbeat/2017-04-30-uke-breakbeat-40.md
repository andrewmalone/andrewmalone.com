I started playing this strumming pattern on my tenor ukulele, and thought it might be a good fit for one of the beats in this series. When I opened up the next file that needed a part, it already had a simple looped bass part in it. I decided I liked what happened when the two parts combined harmonically, so I didn't end up transposing or changing either part.

The main strumming pattern is processed through effects using [Magellan], which is a synthesizer app that I'm only using here for the effects. There's also two baritone ukulele parts underneath.
