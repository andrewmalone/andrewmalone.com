For this one I tried a completely different approach. Usually, I create the drum beats on the bus or subway during my work commute. This time, I was working at home and decided to start with a ukulele part instead. I came up with this:
{% include audio.html audio=page.audio1 %}

Then, I wrote the drum beat to match that part, and ended up adding a second uke part to go with it:
{% include audio.html audio=page.audio_main %}
