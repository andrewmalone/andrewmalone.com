After the more elaborate production of the [last]({% post_url 2016-11-20-uke-breakbeat-25 %}) post, I wanted to simplify again. This is just a simple beat with one uke part, with a few other touches. After 4 bars, the beat adds in a rimshot in sort of a clave pattern to add some variety. The uke is processed through [Dedalus], an interesting delay effect.
