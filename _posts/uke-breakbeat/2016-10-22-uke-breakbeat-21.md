Up until now, all the beats in this series have been made with [KORG Gadget], which has worked really well. Here I'm using a different app for the beat - [Patterning], which has a super cool circular interface and is really a lot of fun to work with.

This beat was originally a bit faster at 128bpm, but I couldn't pull off the uke part I wanted, so I time-stretched it down to 117 in [AUM].
