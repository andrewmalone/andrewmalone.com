I started the beat for this differently than usual. Normally I always start with eigth note hi hats with the accents on each beat.
{% include audio.html audio=page.audio_basic_hihat %}

This time, I started creating the beat by writing a hi hat pattern with different accents and some added notes.

For the ukulele parts - there's an extremly mangled part (processed with [Effectrix]), and a simple picked part on top of that.
