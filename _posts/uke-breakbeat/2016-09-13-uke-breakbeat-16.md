Two things about this beat:

1. The cymbal accents are on 1 and the and of 2, instead of on each beat like most of the beats I've tried so far. 

2. I made three copies of the drum track to apply different effects. One has extremely heavy compression, one is just the ambient room sound, and one is dry. They are mixed together to make a thick compressed sound.
