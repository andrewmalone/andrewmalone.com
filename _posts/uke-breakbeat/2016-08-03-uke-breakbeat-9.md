For this one, I took the exact same beat from the [last pattern]({% post_url uke-breakbeat/2016-07-31-uke-breakbeat-8 %}):
{% include audio.html audio=page.audio1 %}

I slowed it down and changed the drum sounds, but didn't change the drum pattern at all:
{% include audio.html audio=page.audio2 %}

Then I used the exact same uke sound to play along with the slower groove:
{% include audio.html audio=page.audio_main %}
