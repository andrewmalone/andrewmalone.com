It's not a huge secret that I have a soft spot for Christmas music. I've already recorded [plenty of Christmas songs](/christmas), but nothing recently. I was learning this song on the ukulele and it seemed like a perfect fit for this series of posts. All of the backing track (drums and synth) was created on my phone in [KORG Gadget], then I recorded the ukulele parts on the iPad.

The uke arrangement is intended to echo [John Fahey's classic solo guitar Christmas albums][fahey].
