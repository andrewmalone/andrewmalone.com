One of the things I'm trying to do these days is to spend some time exploring new apps. I fall into the common trap of acquiring apps and then not really using them very much. This has been especially true for synths - I like the idea of using lots of different synths, but in practice don't spend enough time tweaking and playing and really getting to know the apps.

I started with tweaking up a sound in [Addictive Synth], and using the app's arpeggiator to create a simple pattern. I recorded this into [Cubasis], and added a timed delay to create a more harmonic pattern (you can hear the delay start in the the second half of this loop).

I wrote a very simple drum part using [FunkBox] Drum Machine.

The bass part is [iFretless Bass] played through a [Bias] amp.

Drums were processed a little bit with [Turnado], then everything mixed in Cubasis and final tweaks in [Final Touch].

It's interesting that starting with a focus on one app ended up using six different apps to create the final result.
