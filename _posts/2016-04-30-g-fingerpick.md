  file: Tenor - G fingerpick

This is another very early pattern I created on the soprano uke. I don't remember the exact inspiration, but I remember specifically trying different fingerpicking rhythms before settling on this. It has a B section that I like a lot, with a bass line that walks down chromatically.

This was played on my [Kala tenor ukulele](/gear/kala-kajte).
