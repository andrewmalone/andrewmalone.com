  file: Tenor - C major open strings
---
As I started learning ukulele, I found myself playing in the key of C a lot. There's several reasons for this - C is a very easy chord, C is also the lowest available note on the ukulele, and the key of C allows for lots of interesting variations using open strings.

This pattern evolved from experiments trying to keep the bottom two strings open as much as possible, and using the low C string as a pedal tone.
