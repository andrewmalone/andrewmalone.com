  file: Tenor - F hybrid
---
I remember coming up with this on my soprano uke, after spending a lot of time playing in C major. I decided to try doing something in F instead, and ended up creating this pattern. It also has an interesting hybrid of picking and strumming, which has become a big part of my style.
