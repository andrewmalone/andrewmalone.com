Here's a new song from [Kate](http://kateleary.net) and me. This song came together quickly - maybe the fastest one yet.

As I wrote in my [last post]({% post_url 2015-02-07-time-off %}), I was home for the past two weeks to focus on music. For a couple days it seemed like Kate was constantly tinkering with this song. Once she was done, I came up with the chords and melody one day and recorded all the tracks the next day. It helped that I kept the arrangement very simple and resisted the urge to do lots of production. It's the most "demo" sounding song we've done so far.

## Recording notes

There are just 4 tracks on this one (well 5 really, since I split the stereo piano onto 2 tracks).

* The piano and electric piano sounds are from [SampleTank] - I intentionally used an upright piano sound for a less "pristine" sound. I also focused *very* hard on keeping the electric piano as understated as possible.
* Bass was recorded through [JamUp].
* I'm continuing to experiment with workflow for main sequencers - lately I've been using [Cubasis] as more of a sketching tool, and then record final tracks directly into [Auria].
* I added some final processing in [Final Touch].
