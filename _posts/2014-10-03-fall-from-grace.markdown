Songwriting is something that hasn't come naturally to me. My wife Kate is a fiction writer, and we've always talked about collaborating more to write songs, but somehow it's been difficult to get into a good routine.

Writing this song was not difficult. Kate had fully formed lyrics and a melody, and all I had to do was fit the chords underneath. Kate has written much more about the process over on [her blog][kate]. You should go read it.

We are both pretty happy with how this came out. I like the feel and the arrangement a great deal.

## Recording notes

* All recording and mixing was done on the iPad using [Cubasis].
* The acoustic ukulele strumming is processed through [JamUp], and I triple tracked it (panned left, right, and center).
* The bass was also processed through [JamUp]. I'm especially proud of the bass line under the chorus. I originally had it mixed even louder, but Kate told me I had to turn it down.
* The more electric ukulele part that comes in on the second verse was recorded through [ToneStack].
* The organ is [Galileo], slightly distorted through [SquashIt].
* The piano is [SampleTank].
* The drum part was programmed using one of the stock kits in Cubasis.
* Kate's vocals (two leads, two harmonies) were recorded direct into Cubasis, and then processed using [Final Touch].
* The reverb used on the track is [AUFX:Space].
* Final processing was done in [Final Touch].
