Here's something I worked up about a month ago while on vacation in [Higgins Beach, Maine](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Higgins+Beach,+ME+04074/).

I've [posted an experiment before](/2014/06/15/uke-layers/) with layers just from the ukulele. This time I was working with processing the sound with [ToneStack] instead of [JamUp]. ToneStack is a newer guitar amp and effects app that is quickly becoming a favorite. The effects are particularly great. There's 6 different tracks going on here, all recorded from the ukulele, each processed differently:

* 3 "drum" tracks (bass, snare, strum rhythm)
* bass track (using a pitch effect to transpose two octaves lower)
* rhythm strum (simple basic distortion)
* "organ" sound - this is a combination of a pitch effect to add harmonics and a volume envelope.

As usual, recording and basic mixing was done in [Cubasis].

Just for kicks, here's what everything sounds like with no processing, just the ukulele tracks. Interestingly, I might actually like this version better. Maybe sometimes all the tweaking and processing isn't actually worth it.
