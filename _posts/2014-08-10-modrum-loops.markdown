One thing I love about making music on iOS is the portability. My commute isn't especially long, but sometimes I try to do some brief creative task while on the subway. Often, I make simple drum beats using [MoDrum], a nice little drum synthesis/pattern app.

Last week I made these 4 beats on one commute. Maybe I'll do something more with them soon - but for now here they are completely unaltered.
