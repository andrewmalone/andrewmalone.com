title: Pono MBD Baritone
---
This is my newest ukulele, purchased in February 2016. Almost as soon as I got my [tenor](/gear/kala-kajte), I started to understand why guitar players keep buying more guitars. As much as I loved playing the Kala tenor (and still do), I wanted to try different instruments and see what I could do with them. 

I was very much attracted to the baritone ukulele size, for both the richer deeper sound as well as the lower tuning. My research led me to this one, the [Pono Mahagonay Baritone Deluxe][pono] which I've been quite happy with so far.
