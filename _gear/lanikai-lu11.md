I got my first ukulele for Christmas in 2010. It is a [Lanikai LU-11 soprano ukulele](http://www.amazon.com/Lanikai-LU-11-Soprano-Ukulele/dp/B0018TF0O8). The idea was to get something relatively cheap to find out if I would enjoy it or not.

I barely ever play on this uke now, but it was all I played for 3 years. It worked out great as a starter uke. The intonation isn't especially great, especially as you move up the fretboard, but it is still very fun to play. Now I use it for hiking trips, since it is so small and light, and would be easy to replace if something happened to it.
