After I'd been playing my [first ukulele](/gear/lanikai-lu11) for 3 years, I decided it was time for an upgrade. The whole ukulele thing had clearly stuck.

I spent a long time doing research before deciding on a [Kala KA-JTE/HB - Archtop Honeyburst Electric Tenor Ukulele](http://www.theukulelesite.com/kala-jte-hb-archtop-honey-burst-electric-tenor-satin-finish.html). I knew I wanted a tenor size and that I wanted something with integrated electronics for recording. The look of this one is what really sold me, I just love the jazz guitar styling.

This instrument is a joy to play, I'm extremely happy with it. It has also made me start to understand why guitar players keep getting new guitars. Each one has a slightly different character and wants to be played on its own terms.
