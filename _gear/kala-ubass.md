I got this [ubass] as a birthday present in the spring of 2015. It is technically not a ukulele, though it is made from a baritone ukulele body. It has thick rubbery strings that have a surprising deep sound - almost like an acoustic bass.

It's a little strange to play, since you need to get used to the string feel and the smaller scale of the neck, so I'm still working on being completely comfortable with it.
