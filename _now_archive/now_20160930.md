title: What I'm doing now...
---

I earn a living as a UX designer and business analyst at [Harvard University][huit], trying to build better administrative tools for managing sponsored research.

I'm married to [Kate Leary][kate] - together we are raising two funny little boys, Oscar (8) and Charlie (5).

I play in a band - the [Ultrasonic Rock Orchestra][uro], bringing classic rock to life with a killer band and 10 singers. Our next show is [October 29 at the Regent Theatre][regent] in Arlington, MA.

When I have time to myself at home, I'm usually either playing one of my ukuleles or exploring the world of iOS music on the iPad.
