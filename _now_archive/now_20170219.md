title: What I'm doing now...
---

I earn a living as a UX designer and business analyst at [Harvard University][huit], trying to build better administrative tools for managing sponsored research.

I'm married to [Kate Leary][kate] - together we are raising two funny little boys, Oscar (8) and Charlie (6).

I play in a band - the [Ultrasonic Rock Orchestra][uro], bringing classic rock to life with a killer band and 10 singers. Our next set of shows will be performing Jesus Christ Superstar:

* At the [Regent Theatre in Arlington, MA][regent] - March 24th, 25th, 26th, 31st & April 1st
* At [Foxwoods Resort Casino][foxwoods] - April 7th and 8th

When I have time to myself at home, I'm usually either playing one of my ukuleles or exploring the world of iOS music on the iPad.
